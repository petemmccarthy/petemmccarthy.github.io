###  This is my presonal website [www.petemmccarthy.com](http://www.petemmccarthy.com)

* Built using the React library, html and css

##### To be finished/fixed/refactored...
* As it's deployed via GitHub pages the URLs created by React Router when you navigate to either 'personal-projects or 'work-experience' aren't recognised if you refresh the page and, therefore, display a '404'. You then need to re-visit [www.petemmccarthy.com](http://www.petemmccarthy.com)
* Correct hover/link behaviour for 'Personal Projects' and 'Work Experience' sections for tablets
